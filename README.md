The code defines a function matrix_mul that multiplies a matrix with a vector, and a function plot_graph that plots the graph of a matrix and two vectors as arrows.
The matrix_mul function takes a matrix A and a vector B as input, and returns the product of A and B.
The plot_graph function takes a matrix A and two vectors u and v as input, and plots the graph of A, u, and v as arrows on a grid.
The code then defines a matrix A and two vectors u and v, and calls the plot_graph function with A, u, and v as arguments to display the graph.
